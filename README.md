# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

This project creates a Deep Neural Network with 4 hidden layers (1500 nodes each) to train and test against the MNIST Handwritten Digit dataset.
The project also uses Convolution Neural Networks with 2 hidden layers against the MNIST dataset

## Getting Started

This project uses the Tensorflow Library in Python and uses Deep Neural Networks and Convolution Neural Networks

### Prerequisites

Tensorflow 1.0
Python 2.7
NVIDIA CUDA GPU (Optional)

### Installing

To install Tensorflow
```
pip install tensorflow
```

## Running the tests

To run the code
```
python deep-net.py
python cnn.py
```

## Built With

* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/docs) - The Deep Learning Library

## Authors
